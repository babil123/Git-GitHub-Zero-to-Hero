# 🧭 **GitHub**

**GitHub** is **primarily a Git repository hosting service** that allows developers to store, manage, and collaborate on code using the **Git version control system**.

It provides both **cloud-based Git hosting** and a suite of **developer collaboration tools**, making it a central platform for open-source and enterprise software development.

---

## ⚙️ **1. Core Purpose — Git Repository Hosting**

GitHub was originally designed to make **Git easier to use**, especially for collaboration across distributed teams.

### 🧩 Key features:

* **Repository Management**: Create, clone, fork, and manage repositories.
* **Branching & Merging**: Supports all Git operations like branching, merging, pull requests, and commits.
* **Pull Requests (PRs)**: Allow contributors to propose changes and discuss them before merging.
* **Issues & Discussions**: For bug tracking, feature requests, and community discussions.
* **Access Control**: Manage repository visibility — public or private — and control collaborator permissions.
* **Web Interface + CLI**: You can use GitHub via web UI, CLI (`gh`), or REST/GraphQL APIs.

---

## 🧱 **2. GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)**

### 🧰 **What it is:**

**GHCR (GitHub Container Registry)** is GitHub’s **container image hosting service** — similar to Docker Hub — built into the GitHub ecosystem.

### 🚀 **Purpose:**

It allows developers to **build, store, and distribute container images** (like Docker images) alongside their source code.

### 💡 **Features:**

* Host **Docker** and **OCI-compliant** container images.
* Supports **private** and **public** images.
* **Integrated authentication** with GitHub — uses Personal Access Tokens or GitHub Actions tokens.
* **Versioned image tags** linked directly to repository commits.
* **Fine-grained access control** — manage permissions per user, team, or org.

### 🧾 **Example:**

```bash
docker tag myapp ghcr.io/username/myapp:v1
docker push ghcr.io/username/myapp:v1
```

### 🔗 Benefit:

Having code and containers in one platform improves **security**, **traceability**, and **CI/CD integration**.

---

## ⚡ **3. GitHub Actions**

### 🧰 **What it is:**

**GitHub Actions** is GitHub’s built-in **CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)** automation tool.

It lets you **automate workflows** directly from your GitHub repository — such as building, testing, packaging, and deploying your code.

### 🔄 **How it works:**

* Define workflows in `.github/workflows/` using **YAML files**.
* Each workflow runs on **GitHub-hosted runners** (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS) or **self-hosted runners**.
* Triggered by **events** like:

  * `push`
  * `pull_request`
  * `workflow_dispatch`
  * `schedule`

### 🧩 **Features:**

* **Build & Test automation** — e.g., compile a Java project using Maven.
* **Deployment automation** — push to cloud, Docker Hub, GHCR, etc.
* **Reusable workflows** — shareable templates across repos.
* **Integration with GitHub Packages** & GHCR.
* **Secrets management** for credentials and tokens.

### 💡 Example Workflow:

```yaml
name: CI Build

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Build app
        run: mvn clean package
```

## 📊 **4. GitHub Projects**

### 🧰 **What it is:**

**GitHub Projects** is a **project management** feature integrated into GitHub.
It allows teams to **organize, plan, and track work** directly alongside their codebase.

### 🧱 **Two Versions:**

1. **Classic Projects** — Kanban-style boards (like Trello).
2. **Projects (Beta)** — new system using **GitHub Issues + Databases + Filters**.

### 🗂️ **Features:**

* Create project boards for:

  * **To Do**, **In Progress**, **Done**
* Automate issue updates with **Actions**
* Custom **fields** (status, priority, owner)
* **Integration** with GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.

### 💡 Example Use Case:

A development team can:

* Track sprint tasks (Issues)
* Assign owners
* View progress via Kanban or Table views.

---

## 🛒 **5. GitHub Marketplace**

### 🧰 **What it is:**

## ⚙️ **1. GitHub Clone**

### 🧰 **Definition**

👉 **Cloning** a repository means **downloading a full copy** of a GitHub repository (including its history) to your **local machine**.

It creates a **local Git repository** that is connected to the **original remote repository** (usually called `origin`).

### 🧩 **Command**

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
```

Example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nyrahul/wisecow.git
```

### 🧠 **What happens when you clone**

* Git copies **all commits**, **branches**, **tags**, and **files**.
* You can now:

  * Edit files locally.
  * Commit your changes.
  * Push changes back to the same repo (if you have permission).
  * Pull updates from the remote to stay in sync.

### 📁 **Structure after cloning**

```
wisecow/           <-- local folder
  ├── .git/        <-- Git version history
  ├── app.py
  ├── Dockerfile
  └── README.md
```

### 🌐 **Relationship to original repo**

* It **remains connected** to the original repo via a **remote URL**:

  ```bash
  git remote -v
  ```
* If you have write access → you can `push` changes.
* If not → you can only `pull` updates.

### 💡 **When to use `git clone`**

| Scenario                       | Example                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| You’re part of the same team   | You clone the repo, make changes, and push directly. |
| You want to experiment locally | Clone a public repo to study the codebase.           |
| You want a backup              | Clone a repo to another system for offline work.     |

---

## 🌿 **2. GitHub Fork**

### 🧰 **Definition**

👉 **Forking** a repository creates a **copy of someone else’s GitHub repo** **in your own GitHub account** — not just on your local system.

This gives you **your own remote version** of the repository, under your control.

### 📦 **How to Fork**

* Click **“Fork”** on the top-right corner of a GitHub repository.
* GitHub will create:

  ```
  github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>
  ```

  — a **new repository** that is a copy of the original.

### 🧩 **Purpose of Forking**

* To **contribute to someone else’s project** when you don’t have write access.
* To **experiment** with changes safely without affecting the main project.
* To **maintain your own version** of a public repo.

### 💡 **When to use `Fork`**

| Scenario                                | Example                                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| You want to contribute to open source   | Fork → make changes → push → create a Pull Request (PR). |
| You want to modify a repo you don’t own | Fork the repo and customize it for your needs.           |
| You want to build on someone’s codebase | Fork and develop new features independently.             |

## 🔄 **Fork + Clone Workflow (Common in Open Source)**

When you want to contribute to a public project:

### 🪜 Steps:

1. **Fork** the main repository on GitHub.
   Example:

   * Original: `github.com/original-dev/project`
   * Your fork: `github.com/bubu/project`

2. **Clone your fork** to local system:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bubu/project.git
   ```

3. **Create a new branch** for your feature:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-update
   ```

4. **Make changes and commit**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added new feature"
   ```

5. **Push changes to your fork**:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature-update
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request (PR)** to the **original repository**.

   * GitHub will detect your fork and branch.
   * You request the maintainers to merge your changes.
